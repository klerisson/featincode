Featincode is a suite of tools to help developers in comprehension and maintenance tasks, specially when dealing with unfamiliar code. It started as a master thesis project and now is public to gain collaboration of other developers and stakeholders.

It was entirely made in Java. The idea is to help developers to locate features in unfamiliar source code. The inputs for the process are the target system domain concepts (which should be translated into a Feature Model), the source code and a scenario to exercise the interested features of the target system in runtime.
